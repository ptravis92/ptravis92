## Salutations! 👋

I’m Paul, a full stack developer with a passion for code concision and clarity. Though I’ve coded in Angular and .NET for the majority of my career, I am open to working in new paradigms or continuing to grow in those technologies. I hope to obtain a role that will allow me to use my current skills, while expanding my responsibilities and fostering continued technological learning.
